# NeuralNetworks

- AdaGradOptimizer.ipynb contains code implementing a custom AdaGrad neural network gradient descent optimizer from scratch.

- LogisticRegression.ipynb contains code for training a neural-network-based logistic regression classification model from scratch in PyTorch.

- MNIST.ipynb contains code for implementing, training, and error-scoring a series of feedforward neural networks, in Keras, for recognizing handwritten MNIST digits (with a best macro average test F1 score of 97%).
